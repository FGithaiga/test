# 🧠 DSC_COURSE Repository

Welcome to the **DSC_COURSE** repository! This project contains my structured learning journey through a Data Science curriculum, including hands-on labs, code challenges, and projects.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **phases**, each corresponding to a core focus area in the Data Science workflow:

### 📦 Phase_1 – Data Collection & Cleaning
> Focuses on collecting raw data, cleaning it, and preparing it for analysis.
- Loading CSVs and APIs
- Handling missing values
- Data type conversions
- Pandas fundamentals

### 📦 Phase_2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
> Emphasizes visual and statistical techniques to understand data patterns.
- Univariate & bivariate analysis
- Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Correlation and distribution analysis

### 📦 Phase_3 – Statistics & Inference
> Covers hypothesis testing and statistical thinking for making data-driven decisions.
- Probability distributions
- Confidence intervals
- T-tests and ANOVA
- Code challenge on sample network data

### 📦 Phase_4 – Machine Learning Fundamentals
> Introduces supervised learning and model evaluation techniques.
Includes the following labs:
- `dsc-distance-metrics-lab`
- `dsc-k-nearest-neighbors-lab`
- `dsc-knn-with-scikit-learn-lab`
- `dsc-nonparametric-models-lab`
- `dsc-gridsearchcv`
- `dsc-pipelines-lab-v2-1`
- `dsc-pipelines-v2-1`
- `dsc-refactoring-with-pipelines`
- `dsc-tuning-pipelines-intro`
